 * 
 * The Common Language Runtime (CLR) allows a level of integration between 
 * itself and a host. This C++ code sample demonstrates using the Hosting 
 * Interfaces of .NET Framework 4.0 to host a specific version of 
 * CLR in the process, load a .NET assembly, and invoke the types in the 
 * assembly.
 * 
 * The code sample also demonstrates the new In-Process Side-by-Side feature in 
 * .NET Framework 4. The .NET Framework 4 runtime, and all future runtimes, are 
 * able to run in-process with one another. .NET Framework 4 runtime and beyond 
 * are also able to run in-process with any single older runtime. In ther words, 
 * you will be able to load 4, 5 and 2.0 in the same process, but you will not 
 * be able to load 1.1 and 2.0 in the same process. The code sample hosts .NET 
 * runtime 4.0 and 2.0 side by side, and loads a .NET 2.0 assembly into the two 
 * runtimes.
